spoiler: A little bit about me and my background
---

I’m `Jerwin Samuel`, a Software Engineer 💻 from India and based in Chennai.

I graduated with a B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from Anna University, where I worked on a face recognition project (Undergraduate) 🕵️‍♂️ which got me hooked into the exploring more about computer science and programming in general.

I'm currently working on projects that revolve around Python programming, Machine Learning, NLP, Payments and other exciting software development projects involving algorithms. 🚀

Previously, I've worked for `Amazon`, `Wipro` and `IGSL`. I worked alongside a talented 🙌 group of people focusing on Kindle 4.0 content quality in Amazon India, global banking payment investigations in IGSL - `Barclays PLC` and global banking payment system transformation in Wipro - `Sate Street`. I helped these banking clients to transition from an old legacy payment system to a modern industry-standard system like Global Pay Plus. 👨‍💻

I was given an opportunity to `lead` a payment investigations team alongisde my QA team in IGSL which looked after two operations' branch (Chennai & Mumbai) consisting of 140+ people. I have also worked as a `Business Analyst` & `Senior Software Test Lead` managing a team of 6 people where we were awarded 'Best Team' in Q2 2019 - Wipro. 👑

As my interests grew 💭 more towards software development, data science and machine learning, I saw myself focusing more on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">self-learning</a> computer science concepts, getting involved in local community groups via meetup and attending conferences like <a href="https://in.pycon.org/" target="_blank">Pycon India</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/events/community-day/" target="_blank">AWS Community Day</a> etc.

When not thinking about CS, I write ✍️, spend time with my family and friends, travel and imagine myself writing a book in the future 😅. I'm a big fan of the <a href="https://diablo.blizzard.com/" target="_blank">Diablo series</a>, chill lo-fi music and read a fair share of technical books.
