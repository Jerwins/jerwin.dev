This is a short way to unsecure your PDF if you did not know already. I noticed that when I tried to submit my TOEFL score report (PDF) during my masters degree application process, the university portal repeatedly gave me an error saying 'Error processing PDF - Do not password protect' 😒

Even though the document did not have any password protection, this repeatedly happened even after re-uploading. I checked the title bar of the PDF document in Acrobat Reader and saw the tag - `filename.pdf(SECURED)`. 👀

Here's how you can unsecure the document: 🧙‍♂️
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>🌟 Download the original secured PDF
<li>🌟 Drag the PDF onto a new tab in chrome 
<li>🌟 Right click, select print and choose 'save as PDF' from the drop down list.
<li>🌟 Open the newly saved PDF and check if the `SECURED` is not present on the top.
</ul>
<br/>
That's it! 😄 Use it and reupload to wherever you are requested to submit. You won't be getting any error afterwards.
