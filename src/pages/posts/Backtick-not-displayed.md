## FC660C backtick option

If you are wondering how to use backtick in FC660C keyboard. The default ESC key setting configurations for backtick is -> `FN + ESC` = `

To change default ESC key setting to FN key setting, press `FN + Q` = this will change the ESC key to backtick (`) by default.

Please note the directions may vary depending on which version of Windows 10 you are currently using. So don't get frutrated like me. üòí 

## So what was the problem I was facing?

My problem was that backtick worked but I couldn't see it in the text editor to use it. This confused me so much. üòÖ

So if you are like me facing this problem, search for active application that uses the backtick (`) key as a hotkey in it. For example, in my system EVGA Flow Control runs on windows startup because I use EVGA CLC 280 and was assigned backtick by default for taking screenshots. Hence whenever I used FN + ESC, the backtick functioned and filled my desktop with screenshots instead of allowing me to use the key in my mardown file. 

Re-assign the hotkey to something else and you'll be able to see backtick in your md file. üí≠

Hope this helps. ‚≠êÔ∏è
