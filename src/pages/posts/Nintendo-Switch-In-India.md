🎮: Does Nintendo sell the Switch in India? 
<br/>
Nintendo does not sell software (games) or hardware officially in India. All the ones you can buy in India are imported and sold by <a href="https://www.amazon.in/s?k=Nintendo+Switch" target="_blank">third-parties</a> in India.

🎮: If I buy one, do I get warranty here? 
<br/>
No. Some sellers might provide 10-day replacement or damage replacement but I highly doubt it. If you get joycon-drift or your console goes haywire, time to buy a new console or joycons.

🎮: Can I buy Switch games in India? 
<br/>
You can either buy games: 1) Digitally from the Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/buy-digital/" target="_blank">`eShop`</a> by registering an account in US-region 2) Get physical copies from Amazon India 3) Buy or exchange used ones from CEX, Gameloot, GameXS, IndianVideoGamer, erodov, Techenclave or your local importer.

I do not endorse any of these sites - buy it at your own risk and please use common sense. 

🎮: Should I buy the `Switch Lite` or `Switch V1` (MOD-HAC-001) or `Switch V2` (MOD HAC-001-01)
<br/>
Depends on your budget. Lite (do not pay more than ₹15,000) is the cheapest however if it suffers from joycon drift issue, you'd have to replace the entire console if you reside in India as joycons aren't detachable/replaceable like in the other versions 😞. Between V1 and V2, except for the battery life there aren't any major changes. If you can afford the Switch V2 (do not pay more than ₹23,500), go for it.

🎮: How do I spot the difference between Switch V1 (2017) and V2 (2019)?
<br/>

🎮: How does the battery life compare between Switch V1 and V2? 
<br/>
If you ask my honest real-life opinion, battery performance isn't very good at all in the Switch. If your Switch turns off in 2-4 hours, do not be surprised. Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd5DkMCiJvE" target="_blank">useful video</a> for charging and discharging comparisons.

🎮: Should I buy an used Switch console? 
<br/>
I wouldn't recommend it. That's just me paranoid about spending 20k only to get a drift issue or ending up with worn out battery. If you really trust someone in your trading or gaming community and found it for a great price, sure go for it.

🎮: Does it have a touch screen? 
<br/>
Believe it or not, I only found out that my Switch V2 had a touch screen two days after purchase. That's how useless it has been for me. 😜

🎮: How can I check the battery % for individual joycons? 
<br/>
You can't. You can only see the battery percentage for console. You can see an approximate value of your battery status by going to the controller section from the home screen. Do not confuse the blue indicators on top of the joycons as battery indicators - they are not. Check this useful <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baIjtyMPB4o" target= "_blank">60 second video</a> for more information.

🎮: How to charge your Nintendo Switch and Joycons? 
<br/>
I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-yB2AU2aQ" target="_blank">video</a> to be useful. Thanks kid!
