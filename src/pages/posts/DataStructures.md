## What is a data structure? 

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

### Why do we use them?
<ul>
<li>They are used to create fast and powerful algorithms.
<li>They help to manage and organize data.
<li>Most practically useful application would be that they make your code cleaner and easier to understand.
</ul>

## Abstract Data Type

` ADT` or abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to using an data structure. This does not explicitly give out the implementation of a data structure. For example, 

ADT | Implementation
------------ | -------------
List | Dynamic Array, Linked List
Queue | Linked list, Stack and Array based queues
Map | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table

<br/>
ADT defines how a data structure should behave and what methods it should and not the details surrounding how those methods are implemented.
