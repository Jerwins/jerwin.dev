Social media does get boring once in a while. Especially if you don't have a good network of friends online. Here's a thing you can do on Twitter that will make your day and most importantly others day a lot better! 

## 100DaysOfCode 🎀

Search for <a href = "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&f=live" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a> on Twitter. The embedded link is sorted by latest and I'd recommend starting from there.

`100DaysOfCode` is a vouch ✍️ that you'd code for 100 days straight to develop the habit of learning coding skills, practise, building networks in social media and creating your own portfolio of projects to make you employable. 

Ofcourse everyone has their own definition of the streak, be it 100 alternate days or strictly weekends. It doesn't matter as long as it gets you in a rhythm to code often and accomplish learning new concepts in that timeline. You can find more about the positive aspects <a href = "https://www.100daysofcode.com/about/" target="_blank">`here`</a>. 🎁

Most of these people are either new to coding, upskilling to get a better job or starting from scratch to become employable 💭. I have tried this and I'll tell you that it's really hard to keep yourself motivated when there's no one to tell you that `it's going to be okay` or it is `alright to have bad days`. Not that we actively lookout for a tweet of inspiration or appreciation, but it is good for the mind to feel that we are on the right track. 👨‍💻

I want you to see these tweets from random strangers and say some encouraging words 💜, like `You can do this!`, `You got this, buddy`. Also, if you know what they are doing technically, engage in a good positive conversation and give them tips. They'd appreciate it a lot. Although there are bots that auto-like and retweet tweets tagged under #100DaysOfCode, I believe a good human touch beats them all and warms the person's heart. 🙌

Try it and watch them respond and feel appreciated. Even if they don't respond, you did a good deed for the day, my friend. I'm proud of you! 😍
