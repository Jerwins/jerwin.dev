Hi there! Welcome to my blog. :)

I'll try to make this as simple as possible and get straight to the point.

This blog will mostly contain the technical concepts that I learn every day relating to computer science, math and technology that excites me.

Main theme being that I'd like to make it as simple as possible to understand in writing without much jargons or at least explain the technical jargons in layman's terms. 

What you can expect is blog posts on fundamentals of computer science, data structures and algorithms, latest news that I liked from Twitter, conference talks, FAANG news, books, motivational quotes and many more.

If my posts helped you in some way, please let me know <a href  = "https://twitter.com/jerwinsamuel" target="_blank">@jerwinsamuel</a>. I'd very much appreciate it. 💜
